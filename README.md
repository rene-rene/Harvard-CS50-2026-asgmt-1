Dutch National Flag algorithm implemented and animated in Scratch
This program runs an algorithm for the classic Dutch National Flag problem: given a series of colored dots or squares, rearrange them —within the same array of squares— according to the red, white and blue colors of the Dutch flag.

To run the program:
1. Download the `.sb3` file
2. Open https://scratch.mit.edu
3. File → Load from your computer
4. Pressing the spacebar (once or more times) generates a row of randomly ordered colored squares. Pressing "R" executes the DNF algorithm. You should expect to see the colored squares rearranged in the sequence white, blue, red. The necessary swaps are counted and indicated with ticks.

This project illustrates —among other things— abstraction, invariants within an iterative loop, concurrency, and the separation between algorithm and visualization. Applying these concepts makes it easier to understand the program and modify it to add or improve its features.
